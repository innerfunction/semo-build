1. Partial downloads
i.e. 'since' downloads: These are missing db updates; e.g.:
* Create a post in wp
* Next download & build generates the new file content ok;
* But no db update is included.
* To do (efficiently) may require running a diff on the manifest's db section,
  for inclusion in the since zip.

NOTE: Does subs content packaged in the app need to include a build ID?
