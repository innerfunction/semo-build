Incremental build: Startup

* Live build queue should have TTL, like the test queue.

* If the build process is running, then all messages on the queue should be processed within the TTL
  (Need to confirm this; delivery can be near-instantaneous, but download may take time, particularly
   if a lot of updates are being delivered on a particular channel. Is there any limit between receiving
   a message and sending the ACK? What if the message's TTL expires in the time between the message
   being received and the ACK being sent?)

* Each feed has two startup modes:
  1. Install: When the feed is being installed (defined as no feed record/data in the db).
     This requires (1) download of all posts, followed by (2) processing of message queue.
  2. Restart: When the feed is restarted (defined as feed install and feed record/data in db).
     This requires the WP API to resend all un-ACK'd messages in its database.

  - The build queue latency is important in both cases, as it should ensure that multiple update
    messages for the same feed can be processed before the build happens. Even so, it might be
    useful to allow the installer to specify its own build queue latency, to allow a longer value
    than normal, to ensure efficient operation.

x Multiple sequential (or near-sequential) update messages on the queue for the same post can cause
  errors due to doc revision mismatches in the couchdb. The safest thing to do is to ensure that
  download requests for the same URL are queued, i.e. so that a subsequent download request can't
  start until any previous request for the same URL has finished.

x Is manifest being correctly generated? i.e the db section.
  - Need to check that updates are properly merged into the previous manifest
  - Will need to explicitly flag deleted vs. updated records

x Feed record should record the time of last download
