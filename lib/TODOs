2. Allow feeds to specify files to be excluded from the build diff
3. Build script documentation.
x. Add deep-equal to package.json

x. Syntactical sugar:
    Images.resize( opts, file ) - Resize image and write to file, returning FileImages
                                  'file' can be just a boolean true, or a filename template.
        Do similar for other types.

    Images.map( items, name ) - Map images to a named property of each item in an array.
                                Array items are assumed to already have a property of that name with a value related to an image ID.
                                Allow 'name' to be a dotted reference.
                                Relevant to Files also.
