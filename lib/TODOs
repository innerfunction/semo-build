x. semob: Support direct referencing of single feed (i.e. feedID arg is optional)
    > Requires generation of feed ID from module name
    > Also, semob doesn't count number of args properly
2. Allow feeds to specify files to be excluded from the build diff
3. Build script documentation.
x. Add deep-equal to package.json

5. Allow manifest.json to be included in build for incorporation by publisher.

x. Syntactical sugar:
    Images.resize( opts, file ) - Resize image and write to file, returning FileImages
                                  'file' can be just a boolean true, or a filename template.
        Do similar for other types.

    Images.map( items, name ) - Map images to a named property of each item in an array.
                                Array items are assumed to already have a property of that name with a value related to an image ID.
                                Allow 'name' to be a dotted reference.
                                Relevant to Files also.


        json: function( data, filename ) {
            var name = filename && mods.path.basename( filename, mods.path.extname( filename ) );
            var content = new Content( name, JSON.stringify( data ), 'application/json');
            return filename ? content.write( filename ) : content;
        },
