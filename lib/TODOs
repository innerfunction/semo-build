x. Need to review naming scheme, i.e. review the following:
    * Feeds? OK
    * Downloads? OK
    * Installer? OK
    * Naming of cdb design doc & views. Done

x. Need a mechanism to allow a download script to cancel the follow-up build
   (i.e. because no new data has been downloaded).
   Thing here is that as the condition is dependent on the downloaded data, the
   mechanism needs to be async - i.e. the build function just returning true/false
   won't be sufficient.

x. Allow feeds to specifiy a build retention policy - i.e. how are build records
   removed from the system?
   (This may not even be needed; because of the likely efficiency of diff'ing the
   current build with past builds; and the fact that past build content can be
   safely and completely deleted once a new build is generated)
   (Removed for now).

4. Generation of build input/output dir paths in builder.js

5. Build queryier component.
